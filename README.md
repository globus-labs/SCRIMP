SCRIMP is designed to monitor a queue for idle jobs then acquire cloud instances to fulfill them. SCRIMP can be operated as a service where multiple gateways, or queues can be subscribed to a single provisioning instance. SCRIMP will then monitor these queues and acquire instances to join their work pools.
